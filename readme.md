# Simple windows time tracker
_(Simple windows app for time tracking )_

---

I made this app to track time I spend in different programs, to get a better perspective and boost my confidence.

example:

*- Hey, I spent 1000+ hours in VSCode, maybe I DO know how to code ?!*

## If you'd like to use this appyourself, here's how:
1. Make shure to install in folder where app does not need Administrator access to run and change files.

2. **blacklist.txt** - is programs you don't want to track or things like *ApplicationFrameHost* as I did

3. **applications.json** - this is file that stores information about tracked apps. It will be created automatically. Inside this file you can set custom name for your processes (On my computer VSCode process by default is called just *code*, so it would make sence to do it. Also if you feel like cheating you can add yourself a few hours)
